# Graph Coloring

This repository contains an implementation of graph coloring algorithms. Graph coloring is used in various applications, including scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and solving puzzles like Sudoku.

## Features

- **Graph Coloring Algorithms**: Implement algorithms to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Built with TypeScript**: The core of the project is implemented in TypeScript.
- **Styling with CSS**: The project includes CSS for any graphical or visual representation.
- **Lightweight JavaScript**: Minimal JavaScript for additional functionality.

## Deployment

This project is deployed and accessible at: [Graph Coloring on Vercel](https://graph-coloring-ia-2.vercel.app)

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the core TypeScript implementation.
- `styles/`: Includes CSS files for styling.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases to validate the graph coloring algorithms.
